**Statistical Summary:**

1. The variables/coefficients which provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset would be the vehiocle_length and the ground_clearence since 
they provide significant impact to MPG.

2. The slope of the linerar model would not be considered zero since the ***p-value: 5.35e-11*** which would makes the null hypothesis rejected.

3. This linear model prediction on MPG for the MechaCar prototype is not effective since ***Multiple R-squared:  0.7149***, which is too low for a linear model to have a effictive prediction power for MPG.
