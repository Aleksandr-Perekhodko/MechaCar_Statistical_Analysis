## Linear Regression to Predict MPG:

1. The variables/coefficients which provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset would be the vehiocle_length and the ground_clearence since 
they provide significant impact to MPG.

2. The slope of the linerar model would not be considered zero since the ***p-value: 5.35e-11*** which would makes the null hypothesis rejected.

3. This linear model prediction on MPG for the MechaCar prototype is not effective since ***Multiple R-squared:  0.7149***, which is too low for a linear model to have a effictive prediction power for MPG.

The *total_summary* shows that the variance PSI is at 62.29356 which is well within the required 100 PSI variance, which means that the total lot meets design specifications.

(Pic2)

- Lot 1: Variance PSI of 0.9795918 which means that lot 1 does meet the required design specification for manufacturing.
- Lot 2: Variance PSI of 7.4693878 which means that lot 2 does meet the requred design specification for manufacturing.
- Lot 3: Variance PSI of 170.2861224 which means that lot 3 does not fall within the 100 PSI requirement in turn meaning that lot 3 does not meet required design specification for manufacturing.

The following is a boxplot of the differences between the plots:
